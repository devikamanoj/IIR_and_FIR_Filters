To learn about Filters: FIR, IIR and to implement those in MATLAB

## IIR Filters

Analog or digital filters can be used to build IIR filters. The output feedback in digital IIR filters is instantly visible in the equations determining the output. Unlike FIR filters, IIR filters require careful consideration of the “time zone” scenario, because the outputs of the filter have not yet been clearly defined.

## FIR Filters

The impulse response (or reaction to any finite length input) of a finite impulse response(FIR) filter is of limited duration since it settles to zero in finite time. A finite impulse response (FIR) filter is a digitally implemented filter structure that may implement practically any frequency response. An FIR filter is usually implemented by using a series of delays, multipliers and adders to create the filter’s output. FIR filters are also known as feed-forward or non-recursive, or traversal filters.
